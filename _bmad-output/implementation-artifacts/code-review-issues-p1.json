      "body": "## Problem\n\nMultiple packages have security updates and performance improvements available:\n\n**Backend**:\n- `fastapi`: 0.109.0 → 0.115.0+ (security & performance)\n- `pydantic`: 2.12.5 → 2.13.x (security fixes - CVEs)\n- `pytest`: 7.4.4 → 8.x (better performance)\n- `python-jose`: 3.4.0 has known vulnerabilities\n\n**Frontend**:\n- `react`: ^18.2.0 → ^18.3.1\n- `vite`: ^5.0.8 → ^5.4.x (security patches)\n- `typescript`: ^5.2.2 → ^5.7.x (performance)\n- `tailwindcss`: ^3.3.6 → ^3.4.x\n\n## Security Impact\n\n- Pydantic 2.12.5 has known security vulnerabilities\n- `python-jose` has CVEs - consider migrating to `PyJWT`\n- Vite has security patches in 5.4.x\n\n## Proposed Solution\n\n1. Update backend dependencies in `requirements.txt`\n2. Update frontend dependencies in `package.json`\n3. Run full test suite after each ecosystem update\n4. Document any breaking changes\n5. Consider migrating from `python-jose` to `PyJWT`\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n\n- [ ] All major dependencies updated to latest stable\n- [ ] Backend tests pass\n- [ ] Frontend tests pass\n- [ ] No new deprecation warnings\n- [ ] CHANGELOG updated with dependency changes\n- [ ] Security scan shows no critical vulnerabilities\n\n## Implementation Details\n\nSee: `_bmad-output/implementation-artifacts/action-items-2026-02-02.md` Section 6\n\n**Estimated Effort**: 4 hours (+ testing)  \n**Priority**: P1 - Security & Performance  \n**Source**: Code Review 2026-02-02"
