## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security vulnerabilities seriously. If you discover a security issue, please report it responsibly:

1. **Do not** open a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities
2. Report security concerns using GitHub's private vulnerability reporting feature (Security tab, then "Report a vulnerability")
3. Include detailed information about the vulnerability:
   - Description of the issue
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Potential impact
   - Version(s) affected
   - Suggested fixes (if any)

**Response Timeline:**
- Initial acknowledgment within 5 business days
- Status updates every 5-7 days
- Target fix timeline provided within 1 week of confirmation

**What to Expect:**
- **Accepted vulnerabilities**: We'll work with you on a fix timeline and coordinate public disclosure after a patch is released and users have had time to upgrade
- **Declined reports**: We'll provide a detailed explanation if the report doesn't qualify as a security issue

**Coordinated Disclosure:**
Please keep vulnerability details private until we've released a fix and notified users. We'll work with you to coordinate disclosure timing that protects users while giving you proper credit for the discovery.
