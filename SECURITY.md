## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you believe you have found a security vulnerability in this project, **do not open a public issue**.
Instead, please use GitHub’s private security advisories for this repository:

1. Navigate to this repository on GitHub.
2. Click on the **Security** tab.
3. Select **Report a vulnerability** and follow the instructions to open a private security advisory.

When reporting, please include as much of the following information as possible:

- A clear description of the issue and its potential impact.
- Steps to reproduce, including sample code or configuration if applicable.
- The version(s) of this project you tested.
- Any relevant logs, stack traces, or screenshots.

### Response and disclosure process

- We aim to acknowledge new reports within **5 business days**.
- We will provide updates at least every **7 business days** while the issue is being investigated.
- Once a fix is identified, we will work to prepare and release a patch and update the SECURITY.md or release notes as appropriate.
- We prefer **coordinated disclosure**: details of the vulnerability should remain private until a fix has been released and users have had a reasonable opportunity to upgrade.
- After a fix is available, we may publish a public advisory summarizing the issue, impact, and remediation steps.
